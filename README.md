### Purpose
This project is all about making the internship recruitment process smoother and less time-consuming. Instead of manually tracking candidates and sending the same emails repeatedly, the goal is to create a system that automatically handles those routine tasks—so the HR team can spend more time having real conversations and less time on administrative work. The system is meant to improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and support consistent communication while managing a large number of applicants.

### Goals
- Personalize and send onboarding or pre-interview emails based on predefined templates.  
- Track recruitment stages and update statuses in real-time within the same Google Sheet.  
- Use the Gmail API (instead of `GmailApp.sendEmail` and `MailApp.sendEmail`) to get around email sending limits and support larger-scale outreach.  
- Move candidates to corresponding sheets once they’ve reached certain stages—so only active applicants remain in the system. This keeps things clean, scalable, and easy to manage.  
- Keep all information in one central place—eliminating the need to jump between tabs or lose track of past interactions.  
- Use smart logic to only contact the right candidates at the right time.

### Impact
This automation will significantly reduce the workload of HR team members by eliminating repetitive tasks such as email drafting, sending, and manual status updates. It will help ensure timely communication with candidates, leading to a smoother and more professional recruitment experience. Ultimately, the project will support the organization’s ability to recruit more effectively, especially when handling large internship intakes.
