# Calendly Email Extractor

## Purpose
This project aims to automate the process of extracting interview appointment details from Calendly invitation emails sent to Gmail. It simplifies intern applicant tracking by retrieving essential information, such as the invitee’s name, email, and event date/time—and recording it in a structured format within a Google Sheet.

## Goal
The primary goals of this project are to:

- **Automatically identify and process unread Calendly notification emails** from a Gmail inbox.
- **Extract key appointment details** using pattern matching and parsing techniques.
- **Store the extracted data in a designated Google Sheet**, ensuring information is centralized, organized, and accessible to the team.
- **Reduce manual work and minimize oversight** in managing intern interviews.
- **Label and mark emails as read** to avoid duplication.
- **Execute this process on a scheduled basis** using a Google Apps Script time trigger.

## Impact
This automation significantly improves operational efficiency in managing intern interview schedules by:

- Saving time and reducing human error associated with manual data entry.
- Ensuring timely access to up-to-date scheduling data for the recruitment team.
- Enhancing tracking and accountability by maintaining a record of all scheduled interviews in one place.
- Providing scalability as interview volume grows, with minimal need for manual intervention.
